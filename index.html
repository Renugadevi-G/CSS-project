        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p> A good Content Marketing Manager can find hundreds of associations with a given ingredient, its scent or the value of the whole brand which offers a given perfume. Let’s take a look at the example of Alien Flora Futura by Mugler. The perfume has notes of citrus, Buddha wood, amber and sandalwood. What does the client learn from this description? Basically nothing. Most consumers associate a fragrance based on a maximum of two ingredients… And yet, by mastering the art of using words, one can present such a product in the loveliest way: “Alien by Mugler was launched at the beginning of 2018. The unique pink bottle, whose colour reminds you of the sky at dawn, hides a fragrance composed with a vision of light at the heart of a desert – strong and beautiful. Just like Alien Flora Futura, it makes everything possible: loving, dreaming, being yourself.”</p>
